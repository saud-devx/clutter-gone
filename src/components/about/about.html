    <h3 class="text-center fw-bold mb-3">ABOUT US</h3>
    <p class="about-band-intro text-center mb-4">
      Clutter-b-gone originated from my passion to help and transform people’s
      lives by using my expertise in decluttering and organising spaces to help
      clients reclaim their space and simplify their lives.
    </p>

    <div class="about-band-body mx-auto">
      <p>
        Having worked in public services helping others for 15 years, I decided
        the time was right to start my business in professional organising so I
        could continue doing what I love! Helping people. Over the last 15
        years, I have managed multiple projects, organised events and worked
        with people to achieve their goals which has enabled me to define my
        skill set as a professional organiser and ensures I am the right person
        to help you. I work with my clients to understand what you want to
        achieve, understand your space and belongings and understand any
        concerns you may have. This is done through a FREE initial 30 minute one
        on one consultation. This allows me to truly understand the best way
        forward to help you and design a bespoke plan for my clients.
      </p>

      <p>
        I can work with you or without you to organise your spaces, rooms and
        homes to ensure your spaces are functional, comfortable and clutter
        free. I can help working professionals who don’t have the time to
        declutter, families and students who need to create functional and
        spacious environments, individuals who are overwhelmed with clutter and
        need help knowing where to start and I work extremely closely with
        homeowners who struggle with hoarding, allowing the time and sensitivity
        that is needed to start taking steps to a clutter free life.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-0">
        I am proud to offer discounts on my pricing so the more time you invest
        in decluttering and organising your spaces, the cheaper it becomes.
